Backstory and Why
----------------------------

Some of my friends and I play DnD. In our campaign there is an organized crime group of halflings called The Kneebreakers. Some of us had the idea to start a business where we comission The Kneebreakers to run a gambling circle at our base of operations. The idea being that we have found a believable way to generate passive income. I built this file to generate a daily report of how the business went, and to give depth to the story. 

Logic
----------------------------

1. Random number of clientele
2. Each client has a 65-99 chance to visit a gambling table
3. Range of rounds they play at the table
    a. cap could be a total of 25GP lost
4. Range of bets they place per round 
    a. range is 1-4GP
5. House has 65-70 chance to win 
6. Kneebreaker takes percentage or flat fee 
7. Result is the houses take
